For our project, “Noah’s ark” we created an environment where we can see different animals wandering around, a river and a boat.
The game starts by showing a menu scene where the player can choose either to start the game or to quit it. 
This scene shows both at the beginning of the game and when the end ends so the players can choose if they want to play again or not.
Now we will focus on the different elements of the game.
ENVIRONMENT
During the game, we will be listening to the sound of a rain that will increase its intensity through the time. Moreover, we will see 
how the rain increases with time. This will mark the beginning and the end of the game. The players will be able to see how much time
lasts and how many animals have they saved since there will be displayed a timer and a counter on the screen.
RIVER
The river will be increasing its size as time goes by. This will make the playing area smaller and smaller until there is no space left 
for the animals to walk and the game will finish then. 
ANIMALS
In the game we can see multiple pairs of animals that the player has to save from being drowned. To do so, the players have to jump 
to the same type of animal, each to a different animal of the pair. The animals won’t be able to walk through the river which will 
make the playing area smaller as time goes by. Each type of animal has its own sound, and when it passes under a player the sound isplayed.
PLAYERS
We have two players who will have the sensor on their feet.
The players, either to select to start/quit the game and to save the pair of animals will have to jump (on the bottom and on the 
animals respectively). Both players will have a circle on their position that will change its color when an animal passes through it.
The circle will remain red until the player passes over an animal, then the sensor will change its color to blue and will activate the
sound of the corresponding animal.
